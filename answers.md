This structure of taking the users input and changing the subject works when it is just a casual conversation when there is no need for there to be real intelligence. For example a statement like "I want to go home" responds with "why do you want to go home". This works because it keeps the user talking and it seems like a natural thing to respond to a want statement with a "why" statement. However when the user wants deeper input like I when he/she asks "I want you to add 3 and 4" then there is only a "why" response. This makes the program again, one dimensional and there needs to be deeper phrase recognition. To imporve this there should be a randomizer that switches between responses. For example, if the user says they want fried chicken then the computer could also respond with "[user input] sounds nice"
